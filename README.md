<h1>Creating and Administering a Help Desk Ticketing System</h1>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
This project involves the creation of a Help Desk ticketing system with the use of an Azure virtual machine. Additionally, there will be a significant amount of programs that will need to be downloaded. Specifically, we will need to enable Internet Information Services (IIS), and dowload programs such as PHP manager for IIS, MySQL, HeidiSQL, osTicket software, visual C++ distributable, and URL rewrite. Once the ticketing system is created, we can create different departments, roles, teams, agents, and users. Additionally, we can create help topics when users submit tickets, and create Service Level Agreements (SLA's) based on the severity of different tickets. Furthermore, we can act as users by submitting tickets, and then respond to those tickets by using administrator accounts. The goal of this project is to educate individuals on the administration of ticketing systems, and provide experience in the creation and response of ticket requests. 
<h2>Platforms and Technologies Used</h2>
